# Unprotected admin functionality
Reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-unprotected-admin-functionality

```ad-done
title: Solution
1. Go to the lab and view ``robots.txt`` by appending ``/robots.txt`` to the lab URL. Notice that the ``Disallow`` line discloses the path to the admin panel.
2. In the URL bar, replace ``/robots.txt`` with ``/administrator-panel`` to load the admin panel.
3. Delete ``carlos``.
```

# Unprotected admin functionality with unpredictable URL
Reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-unprotected-admin-functionality-with-unpredictable-url

```ad-done
title: Solution
1. Review the lab home page's source using Burp Suite or your web browser's developer tools.
2. Observe that it contains some JavaScript that discloses the URL of the admin panel.
3. Load the admin panel and delete ``carlos``.
```

# User role controlled by request parameter
Reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-user-role-controlled-by-request-parameter

```ad-done
title: Solution
1. Browse to ``/admin`` and observe that you can't access the admin panel.
2. Browse to the login page.
3. In Burp Proxy, turn interception on and enable response interception.
4. Complete and submit the login page, and forward the resulting request in Burp.
5. Observe that the response sets the cookie ``Admin=false``. Change it to ``Admin=true``.
6. Load the admin panel and delete ``carlos``.
```

# User role can be modified in user profile
Reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-user-role-can-be-modified-in-user-profile

```ad-done
title: Solution
1. Log in using the supplied credentials and access your account page.
2. Use the provided feature to update the email address associated with your account.
3. Observe that the response contains your role ID.
4. Send the email submission request to Burp Repeater, add ``"roleid":2`` into the JSON in the request body, and resend it.
5. Observe that the response shows your ``roleid`` has changed to 2.
6. Browse to ``/admin`` and delete ``carlos``.
```

# URL-based access control can be circumvented
Reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-url-based-access-control-can-be-circumvented

```ad-done
title: Solution
1. Try to load ``/admin`` and observe that you get blocked. Notice that the response is very plain, suggesting it may originate from a front-end system.
2. Send the request to Burp Repeater. Change the URL in the request line to / and add the HTTP header ``X-Original-URL: /invalid``. Observe that the application returns a "not found" response. This indicates that the back-end system is processing the URL from the ``X-Original-URL`` header.
3. Change the value of the ``X-Original-URL`` header to ``/admin``. Observe that you can now access the admin page.
4. To delete the user ``carlos``, add ``?username=carlos`` to the real query string, and change the ``X-Original-URL`` path to ``/admin/delete``.
```

# Method-based access control can be circumvented
Reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-method-based-access-control-can-be-circumvented

```ad-done
title: Solution
1. Log in using the admin credentials.
2. Browse to the admin panel, promote ``carlos``, and send the HTTP request to Burp Repeater.
3. Open a private/incognito browser window, and log in with the non-admin credentials.
4. Attempt to re-promote ``carlos`` with the non-admin user by copying that user's session cookie into the existing Burp Repeater request, and observe that the response says "Unauthorized".
5. Change the method from ``POST`` to ``POSTX`` and observe that the response changes to "missing parameter".
6. Convert the request to use the ``GET`` method by right-clicking and selecting "Change request method".
7. Change the username parameter to your username and resend the request.
```
